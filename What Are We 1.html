                        <p>We are now living in a global village. Everything is just a doorstep away. But still without proper guidance anyone can lose his/her path. Which in terms turns into delicate condition. <br><br>
                      According to a survey of WORLD BANK, In Bangladesh, a little more than 4% of the 17-23 age cohorts receive higher education with a very limited access to resources. As quality of education is low particularly in some of the newer private universities and in the affiliated colleges, Students face difficulties in recruiting, retaining adequate professional development. The absence of a national strategy for research creates weak linkages between university and industry. The low levels of government funding and the very high percentage of that funding allocated to salaries, leading to inadequate funding for equipment, computers, books and journals and building maintenance. The limitations of the national ICT infrastructure which, combined with low funding, lead to very limited access to the internet and the international academic community by staff and students.<br><br>
                      Every year, 676623 students are graduating from Public universities Annual Education Survey(AES) 2016 reveals that there were 130 Universities in Bangladesh, 38 (29%) were public and 92(71%) were private. Total number of students was 823102. Average number of students per University was 6331, the average number of student in public University was 11900 and private University was 4032. <br><br>
                      If we compare the both situation it is mandatory for us to take every possible steps to help these huge population to achieve the quality to become a resource for the country. A country of possibilities doesn’t mean it is full of perfect infrastructure. As A developing country Bangladesh has a long way to go. So far, she proved that change is possible. Researchsio is a platform which is participating in this process.</p>
